# **Healthcare Data-Driven Decision Support Dashboard**  

This project provides a clear and concise **healthcare data analysis** using **Power BI**, focusing on  
**patient admissions**, **billing trends**, and **hospital performance**. The interactive dashboard  
delivers actionable insights for better hospital planning, patient care, and decision-making.

## Project Overview  

The **Healthcare Data Dashboard** is a self-driven data visualization project designed to uncover valuable insights from a dataset of 55,000+ patient records.  
The dataset covers **demographics**, **admission types**, **billing amounts**, **medical conditions**, and **hospital information**.  

The project focuses on:  
- **Data cleaning** and preparation  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends  
- Building an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize patient distribution, cost patterns, and hospital performance 

Using **Excel** for preprocessing and **Power BI** for reporting, the project demonstrates how raw healthcare data can be converted into actionable insights for improved operational decision-making.

## Project Goals  

- **Clean and prepare** raw healthcare data for analysis  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends, patterns, and distributions  
- Develop an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize patient, billing, and hospital insights  
- Deliver insights that **support data-driven decision-making** in healthcare operations  

## Dataset  

- **Source:** [Healthcare Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset)  
- **Size:** ~55,000 patient records  
- **Key Fields:**  
  - **Demographics:** Age, Gender  
  - **Admissions:** Admission type, discharge details  
  - **Medical Data:** Diagnoses, treatments, billing amounts  
  - **Hospital Info:** Facility and doctor metadata  

## Tools Used  

- **Microsoft Excel** – For data cleaning, preprocessing, and basic exploration  
- **Power BI** – For building interactive dashboards and visualizing key insights  

> **Note:**  
> The initial plan was to use **MySQL** for data cleaning and preprocessing.  
> However, due to system limitations in handling large data imports,  
> **Microsoft Excel** was chosen as a more practical and efficient alternative.


## Dashboard Highlights  

| **Insight**              | **Description** |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| **Total Patients**       | Over **55K records** analyzed across multiple hospitals |
| **Medical Conditions**   | Covers key conditions like **Arthritis, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity**, etc. |
| **Avg. Billing by Age**  | Highest average billing observed in **36–50 age group** |
| **Hospital Overview**    | Displays patient count per hospital and **average length of stay** |
| **Admission Types**      | Breakdown of **Elective, Emergency, and Urgent** admissions |
| **Interactive Filters**  | Slice data by **year, age group, gender, and admission type** |
| **Reset Button**         | **One-click reset** to clear all slicers and return to default view |


## Key Insights  

- **Elective (33.61%)** and **Emergency (33.47%)** admissions make up the majority of hospital visits  
- Patients aged **36–50** show the **highest average billing** across all age groups  
- **Average length of stay** is approximately **15.5 days** per patient  
- **Billing amounts** and **patient volume** differ notably between hospitals

## Conclusion  

This interactive dashboard delivers a clear snapshot of key healthcare metrics, helping optimize **resource allocation**, **patient management**, and **billing efficiency**. It serves as a practical starting point for **healthcare analysts** and **decision-makers** to drive data-backed strategies.  


## Notes  

- Data cleaning and preprocessing were completed in **Microsoft Excel** before building the dashboard.  
- **MySQL** integration is planned for future updates to handle larger datasets more efficiently.  
- Dashboard **screenshots** and the **.pbix file** are available in the `assets` folder for easy reference.
